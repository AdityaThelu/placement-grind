# Placement Grind

## Project Overview

This project provides a collection of C++ programs designed for practice and preparation for software engineering placements. It covers fundamental programming concepts and algorithms commonly encountered in technical interviews and coding assessments.

## Features

The project includes the following programs:

- **Sum of n Numbers:** Calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers.
- **Prime Number in Range:** Determines if a number is prime and finds all prime numbers within a specified range.
- **Sum of Numbers in Range:** Computes the sum of all numbers within a given range.
- **Greatest of 3 Numbers:** Finds the largest among three input numbers.
- **Positive Negative:** Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Calculator:** Implements a basic calculator with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Greatest of 2 Numbers:** Finds the larger of two input numbers.
- **Even/Odd:** Determines if a number is even or odd.
- **Print Not Divisible by 3:** Prints all numbers in a range that are not divisible by 3.
- **Basic Q4:** A program related to a specific question, likely from a coding challenge or assignment.
- **While Loop:** Demonstrates the use of a while loop in C++.
- **Leap Year Check:** Determines if a given year is a leap year.
- **Sum of First n Numbers:** Calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using a different approach.
- **For Loop:** Demonstrates the use of a for loop in C++.
- **Add Digits:** Calculates the sum of digits in a given number.
- **Prime Number:** Determines if a number is prime.
- **Prime:** Another program related to prime number determination.
- **Main:** Likely a main function file that orchestrates program execution.

## Installation

This project does not appear to have a specific package manager or environment manager setup. To run the programs, you will need a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

1. **Install a C++ Compiler:** If you haven't already, install a C++ compiler like g++. You can find installation instructions for your operating system online.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.

2. **Compile the Code:** Use your C++ compiler to compile the desired program. For example, to compile `sumofnnumbers.cpp`:
   ```bash
   g++ sumofnnumbers.cpp -o sumofnnumbers
   ```

3. **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./sumofnnumbers
   ```

4. **Repeat for Other Programs:** Follow the same steps to compile and run other programs within the project.

**Example:**

To run the `sumofnnumbers` program, you would compile it using:

```bash
g++ sumofnnumbers.cpp -o sumofnnumbers
```

Then, run it using:

```bash
./sumofnnumbers
```

The program will prompt you to enter a number and then calculate and print the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers.

**Note:** Replace `sumofnnumbers` with the name of the program you want to run.
